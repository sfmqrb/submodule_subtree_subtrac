# submodule_subtree_subtrac

Get to know about these three "subs" by checking this [link](https://blog.summitto.com/posts/submodules_subtree_subtrac/) and this [link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-subtree).

## Conclusion

* Finally I found submodule more explicit and I like it! After the learning curve it is easier and more to-the-point to use.
* It also makes it easier to give different access permissions to your team.
* Here is a dummy update to test submodule!
